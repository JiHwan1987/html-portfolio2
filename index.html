            <h4>Solving & Critical Thinking</h4>
            <p>
              During my school years, I developed a deep appreciation for
              mathematics and the intellectual challenges it presented. I
              particularly enjoyed approaching problems from multiple
              perspectives, carefully analyzing and solving them step by step.
              For complex problems, I found it both stimulating and rewarding to
              experiment with various methods, persistently working through
              solutions even if it required significant time and effort. The
              process of unraveling these challenges was not merely a task but a
              fulfilling and engaging experience that I relished.

            <h4>My favorite board game!</h4>
            <p>
              My favorite board game is Go. Played on a 19x19 grid, the game
              unfolds as a battle between black and white stones. Within this
              battlefield, players must anticipate their opponent's strategies
              and psychology while thinking many moves ahead to secure victory.
              Go is an immensely complex game, with countless possibilities and
              patterns, making it nearly impossible to master every move. In
              many ways, I find the journey of a programmer to be strikingly
              similar to that of a Go player—both require foresight,
              adaptability, and a deep understanding of intricate systems.
